# MachineLearningPython
- Self-scaling neural network scripts for both classification and regression with cross-validation for both parameter search and model evaluation (parallelized) using Keras
- In classification, class imbalance is solved by synthetic oversampling using SMOTE and the cross-validations are stratified
